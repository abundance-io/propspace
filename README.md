# Propspace

Propspace is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that facilitates the selling and co-ownership of housing units as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Users can purchase units of a property, co-own it, and earn profits based on its performance.

## Overview

Propspace leverages a custom implementation of the DIP-721 NFT standard and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the ICP blockchain to achieve the following:

- **Unitization of Real Estate**: Properties are divided into units represented as NFTs.
- **Property Co-Ownership**: Users can buy and own units, collectively owning the entire property.
- **Profit Sharing**: Co-owners receive profits based on property performance.

## Features

- Unitizing Properties as NFTs
- Purchase and Ownership of Property Units
- Profit Distribution among Co-owners
- DAO Governance and Decision Making
